# Tags
Tags are the names of the virtual desktops were windows live. In other window managers these are sometimes just called desktops. You can rename them to any unicode string including symbols/icons from popular icon libraries such as font-awesome.

Default: `tags = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]`

Example: `tags = ["Browser ♖", "Term ♗", "Shell ♔", "Code ♕"]`
